# E-Waste Generation Classification Project

This project is focused on classifying different categories of electronic waste (E-Waste) using a deep learning model based on **EfficientNetV2B0**. It was developed as part of the Edunet Internship Program.

---

## üìã Project Description
- The project aims to automate the classification of E-Waste for effective recycling and waste management.
- It uses a deep learning model trained on images of various E-Waste categories, including:
  - Battery, Keyboard, Microwave, Mobile, Mouse, PCB, Player, Printer, Television, Washing Machine.
- The trained model is deployed via a simple Gradio web app for easy testing and demonstration.

## üöÄ Features & Innovations
- **Transfer Learning** with EfficientNetV2B0.
- Applied **Data Augmentation** to improve generalization.
- Visualized dataset distribution and model performance using graphs.
- Deployed the model using **Gradio** for a web-based interface.
